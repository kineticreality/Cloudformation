# Cloudformation Templates! 
- Doing things so you don't have to.


My repo to include cloudformation templates for various application servers and things that you might want to exist inside AWS.

Currently 
  - Artifactory Pro : I will refactor this so that either the OSS version or the Pro vesion could be chosen, but at this stage that is what I am needing to build with.
  
Soon
  - Teamcity - Linux
  - Octopus Deploy Server - Windows
  - Chef Server - Linux
  
Future
  - A nice NginX one that sits behind elastic load balancers and has a nice automated way of handing SSL certs with multiple        backend web servers.
